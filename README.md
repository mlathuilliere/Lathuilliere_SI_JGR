Supporting Information: R code for soil CO2 efflux calculations and figures (main text and SI) 

Lathuilliere, M.J. et al. paper under review "Soil CO2 concentrations and efflux dynamics of a tree island in the Pantanal wetland"
submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research - Biogeosciences

This code:
- imports the data obtained from the field measurements described in the Main document
  and publicly available at : https://github.com/UBCecohydro/data.public
- applies CO2 efflux models using CO2 concentrations measured at the site
- generates the Figures that appear in the manuscript
- generates the table of data used in the manuscript
